Tablebases
	Look over and evaluate Gaviota tablebase API
	Implement if possible (much better than working on all those endings)
(working on implementing tablebases from within Arena)

Opening book?
	Bah, use Arena
(using Arena, Done)

ID with seed from last iteration

Break down move list on many chunks so we can use fractions of a time. Depth = 7 takes too long on some positions

Sort move list from values from last iteration.



Display full PV
	Also easy fix (actual: not as easy but DONE!)

Some redumentary eval enhancements
(done)	Bishop pair
	interpolate PSQT 
	Penalty for moving same piece twice
	Think about it as if teaching a 1900 player
		move pieces once before moving one of them twice
		see every move (kind of doesnt apply to the engine)
		
		
CLOP 
Move Ordering
3-move-repetition. 
50 move rule.
How many times do I get a hit on move ordering (first move was actually used.)
